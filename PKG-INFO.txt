Description:
        Inferring communication protocols
        -------------------------------------
        
        Netzob simplifies the work for security auditors by providing a complete framework 
        for the reverse engineering of communication protocols. 
        
        It handles different types of protocols : text protocols (like HTTP and IRC), fixed fields protocols (like IP and TCP) 
        and variable fields protocols (like ASN.1 based formats). 
        Netzob is therefore suitable for reversing network protocols, structured files and system and process 
        flows (IPC and communication with drivers). Netzob is provided with modules dedicated to capture data in 
        multiple contexts (network, file, process and kernel data acquisition). 
Platform: Linux
